      <h3>Leadership Team</h3>
      <p class="big">Our leadership team has over 30 years of education experience.  We've worked in some of the world's best companies, including McKinsey, Clinton Global Health Fund and Ogilvy &amp; Mather.  We've started several companies across East Africa and Europe.  We led one of the most successful scholarship programmes in East Africa, Generation Rwanda, and recently co-founded Kepler, an innovative higher education programme in Rwanda. We know what it takes to train and hire great talent.  And we love doing just that.</p>
