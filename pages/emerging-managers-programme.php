                    <p>Have you just become a manager? Congratulations! So what do you do now? You might have spent the last few years working at being a high performer, but the skills that got you the promotion aren&#8217;t always the skills that you need to be a great leader.</p>
                    <p>The programme is designed to give you the support you need to become a great leader. Over 4 weeks (part-time), it gives you practical lessons from experienced managers with the personal attention to nurture your potential.</p>
